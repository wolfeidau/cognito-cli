# cognito-cli

This is a tool which provides a bunch of utility functions which I really miss from other identity services in one handly command line interface.

# commands

The tool is comprised of a range of handy sub commands, and the ability to search and cache results locally, to avoid nasty rate limiting issues.

# TODO

The following sub commands enable the operation for all users, or a sub set Using a simple filter.

* [ ] Export all users and create a local json file containing the user data
* [ ] Invoke global logout for those users
* [ ] Trigger a password reset for all matching users
